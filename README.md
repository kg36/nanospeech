This project is about reducing the compute needs for Automatic Keyword Spotting. Think of Alexa running off classic tiny Arduino Uno @2KB RAM, 16MHz, 32KB flash.
Wikipedia defines Keyword spotting (KWS) as follows: "Keyword spotting is a problem that was historically first defined in the context of speech processing. In speech processing, keyword spotting deals with the identification of keywords in utterances."
